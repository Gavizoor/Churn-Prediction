In this project, I examined the effects and factors leading to customer churn, using Pyton (with ML Algorithms).
This process was in order to understand trends and what are the factors that affect the customer.
In in this project, at first I cleaned and engineered the data from the database. 
After the data was good enough, I use ML Algorithms (K nearest neighbors, decision tree & rendom forst) - for the data analysis.
The conclusions can be seen in the power point file.
